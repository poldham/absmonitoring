EXPLANATIONS: 

We normally want a precise search for a species we are interested in. This consists of two or more parts that need to be translated into a form that a database can understand when we search

1. We need quotes for an exact match around a phrase: "Azadirachta indica". We normally just use this expression.
2. But a programm may add a + to join the two words into a single expression such as "Azadirachta+indica"
3. This gets translated into %22Azadirachta%20indica%22

When constructing a URL some character such as '"' and + are translated into number and percentage symbols.

" = %22
+ = %20
